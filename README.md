# smartcityIndia
A Corpus of project titles from the Smart City Proposal (SCP) document of all the 100 Smart Cities in India is created. The dataset created has titles of 6249 projects. The projects with more occurrence denote the common infrastructure problem that addressed through SCM. The co-occurrence of projects indicate the inter-connectedness and scope of integration among projects. Text mining is used for creat-ing term maps based on project titles. A term map is a visualization of similarity in which objects (project terms) are located based on the similarity to nearby objects. To create a term map, VOSViewer is used.
